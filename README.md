# Examining-Bias-in-HR-Data
Are there demographic biases in this company's pay, performance scores, and termination reasons? 

Human Resources (HR) Data Set from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set). 

This is a fictitious dataset that was created by Dr. Rich (no last name given) and Dr. Carla Patalano at the New England College of Business. It was developed for a course on HR Metrics and Analytics after the professors noticed a lag in analytical capabilities (and thus, available datasets) for HR departments. This dataset represents all employees at a fictitious company named Dental Magic. Features include names, departments, demographics, performance scores, and reasons for termination. This analysis uses Tableau to examine the question: Are there demographic biases in terms of pay, performance scores, and termination reasons?
